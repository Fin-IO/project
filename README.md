```

## Inspiration
As finance enthusiasts, we wanted to use our programming knowledge to help people like ourselves generate the ideal portfolio based on user preferences.

## What it does
The user will generate will input their income, amount planning to invest, and the risk of the investment. Then, the program will generate the list of ETFs and bonds that might be suitable for the users. Users can also view the history of the price movements.

## How we built it
We use HTML, CSS, and JS for the frontend. Then, we use Python and Flask framework for the backend. We also use yfinance to extract data.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into issues and bugs when writing the Python codes.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We accomplished to build the full stack website overnight,

## What we learned
Time management and teamwork is important.

## What's next for Fin-IO
We're planning to use a voice assistant to help users.
